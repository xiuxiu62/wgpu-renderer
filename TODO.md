[ ] - primitive 3d shapes
[ ] - support for common model formats (gltf to start)
[ ] - linear algebra library w/ custom serialization into gpu layouts
[ ] - robust camera library (similar to dolly, but using my math library)
[ ] - diffuse light rasterization
[ ] - ray tracer (after standard lighting)
[ ] - scene editor (requires a scene format and thoughts about entity system)
[ ] - hot reloading of shaders and assets (watch for changes to assets and reload at runtime) 
[ ] - hot reloading of engine/game code (have separate dylib for everyone inside window surface and rebuild/replace that dylib @ runtime when changes are detected)
